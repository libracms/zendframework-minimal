## RELEASE INFORMATION

*Zend Framework 2.1.4*

This is the fourth maintenance release for the version 2.1 series.

13 Mar 2013

### UPDATES IN 2.1.4

#### Security fix: Query route

The query route was deprecated, as a replacement exists within the HTTP router
itself. You can pass a "query" option to the assemble method containing either
the query string or an array of key-value pairs:

```php
$url = $router->assemble(array(
    'name' => 'foo',
), array(
    'query' => array(
        'page' => 3,
        'sort' => 'DESC',
    ), 
    // or: 'query' => 'page=3&sort=DESC'
));

// via URL helper/plugin:
$rendererOrController->url('foo', array(), array('query' => $request->getQuery()));
```

Additionally, the merging of query parameters into the route match was removed
to avoid potential security issues. Please use the query container of the
request object instead.

For more information on the security vector, please see
[ZF2013-01](http://framework.zend.com/security/ZF2013-01).

#### Security fix: Better RNG support

The `Zend\Math\Rand` component generates random bytes using the OpenSSL
or Mcrypt extensions when available but will otherwise use PHP's
`mt_rand()` function as a fallback. All outputs from `mt_rand()` are
predictable for the same PHP process if an attacker can brute force
the seed - which can be done if the attacker has access to a random number
generated by `mt_rand` or the session ID (if generated without using additional
entropy). 

Zend Framework have revised the `Zend\Math\Rand` component to replace the
current `mt_rand()` fallback for OpenSSL/Mcrypt with Anthony Ferrara's
[RandomLib](https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib), incorporating an additional
entropy source based on [source code published by George
Argyros](https://github.com/GeorgeArgyros/Secure-random-bytes-in-PHP). The new
fallback collects entropy from numerous sources other than PHP's internal seed
mechanism and extracts random bytes from the resulting mixed entropy pool.

For more information on this security vector, please see
[ZF2013-02](http://framework.zend.com/security/ZF2013-02).

#### Security fix: DB platform quoting

Altered `Zend\Db` to throw notices when insecure usage of the following methods
is called: 

- `Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\*::quoteValue*()`
- `Zend\Db\Sql\*::getSqlString*()`

Fixed `Zend\Db` Platform objects to use driver level quoting when provided, and
throw `E_USER_NOTICE` when not provided.  Added `quoteTrustedValue()` API for
notice-free value quoting.  Fixed all userland quoting in Platform objects to
handle a wider array of escapable characters.

[ZF2013-03](http://framework.zend.com/security/ZF2013-03).

#### Better polyfill support

Better polyfill support in `Zend\Session` and `Zend\Stdlib`. Polyfills
(version-specific class replacements) have caused some issues in the 2.1 series.
In particular, users who were not using Composer were unaware/uncertain about
what extra files needed to be included to load polyfills, and those users who
were generating classmaps were running into issues since the same class was
being generated twice.

New polyfill support was created which does the following:

- New, uniquely named classes were created for each polyfill base.
- A stub class file was created for each class needing polyfill support. A
  conditional is present in each that uses `class_alias` to alias the appropriate
  polyfill base as an import. The stub class then extends the base.
- The `compatibility/autoload.php` files in each component affected was altered
  to trigger an `E_USER_DEPRECATED` error asking the user to remove the require
  statement for the file.

The functionality works with both Composer and ZF2's autoloading support, using
either PSR-0 or classmaps. All typehinting is preserved.

Please see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
